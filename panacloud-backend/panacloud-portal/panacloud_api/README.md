# Directory Structure:

## Infrastructure

This directory contains the Infrastructure as Code. This is mostly the files that are deployed through cdk to cloud formation.

## Runtime

This is going to contain the code that is going to be used at runtime, in our case since we are focusing on serverless, this is going to be a bunch of lambdas.
